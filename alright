turns out with cold cathode tubes, CRT's and other light emitting things, you can resonate
the material and the electrons and create different frequencies of light and different colors

that should work. even with diodes, if you can resonate the electrons and change the frequency at which they
lose electrons (ionize) same with air, that should give you whatever colors you want.
